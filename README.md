# SW-MEB #

A Java implementation of the algorithms in KDD'19 paper "Coresets for Minimum Enclosing Balls over Sliding Windows", an extended version of which is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03718).

Please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/hbf/miniball) for the implementation of COMEB.

## Requirements ##

JDK 8 or newer, no third-party libraries required

## Usage ##

### 1. Input Format ###

A dataset is stored in one `.txt` file. Each line of the file represents one point in the dataset. Different dimensions of the point are split by a single space.

```csv
    <p_1> <p_2> ...... <p_m>
    <q_1> <q_2> ...... <q_m>
    ......
```

A synthetic dataset with size `n=1,000,000` and dimension `m=10` is uploaded to folder `/data`.
A few samples are given as follows:

```csv
    0.8 -0.9 2.08 0.76 0.98 -1.68 -0.03 0.12 -0.39 -0.64
    0.05 0.52 -0.82 0.26 -0.45 1.4 0.27 -0.01 0.9 0.86
    0.37 0.4 0.06 0.94 0.44 -0.73 -0.01 -0.16 -0.58 -0.21
    ......
```

### 2. How to Run the Code ###

To run an algorithm for Euclidean MEB:

```shell
    $ java -jar run-meb.jar <alg_name> <dataset_dir> <size> <N> <m> <eps>
    alg_name:    String, the algorithm name (AOMEB, BBC, CoreMEB, DynMEB, SSMEB, SWMEB, SWMEB+)
    dataset_dir: String, the path of the dataset file
    size:        int, the number of points
    N:           int, the window size
    m:           int, the dimension of points
    eps:         float, the parameter epsilon or epsilon_1 (omitted by SSMEB)
```

For example,  

```shell
    java -jar -Xmx80000m run-meb.jar AOMEB data/synthetic-1000000-10.txt 1000000 100000 10 0.001
```

or

```shell
    java -jar -Xmx80000m run-meb.jar SSMEB data/synthetic-1000000-10.txt 1000000 100000 10
```

To run an algorithm for kernelized MEB in RKHS:

```shell
    $ java -jar run-kernel-meb.jar <alg_name> <dataset_dir> <size> <N> <m> <eps>
    alg_name:    String, the algorithm name (AOMEB, BBC, CoreMEB, DynMEB, SSMEB, SWMEB, SWMEB+)
    dataset_dir: String, the path of the dataset file
    size:        int, the number of points
    N:           int, the window size
    m:           int, the dimension of points
    eps:         float, the parameter epsilon or epsilon_1 (omitted by SSMEB)
```

The gamma value (kernel width) of each dataset is stored in `/data/gamma.txt` and read before running an algorithm.

For example,  

```shell
    java -jar -Xmx80000m run-kernel-meb.jar AOMEB data/synthetic-1000000-10.txt 1000000 100000 10 0.0001
```

or

```shell
    java -jar -Xmx80000m run-kernel-meb.jar SSMEB data/synthetic-1000000-10.txt 1000000 100000 10
```

### 3. Output Format ###  

```csv
    <alg_name>
    <dataset_dir> <N> <m> <eps>
    <the timestamp (index of the latest point) when the result is output>
    radius=<the radius of the coreset's MEB> (the radius of approximate MEB returned by SSMEB)
    cpu_time=<CPU time>
    coreset_size=<the size of the coreset>
    num_points=<the number of points stored by SWMEB/SWMEB+>
    meb_radius=<the radius of approximate MEB>
```

To compute the average error:

1. At each timestamp `t`, compute the radius `r` of the MEB of `W_t` (by COMEB for Euclidean MEB or CoreMEB with `eps=1e-9` for kernelized MEB);
2. The relative error of an algorithm at timestamp `t` is `(meb_radius-r)/r`;
3. Compute the average error of an algorithm for all sampled timestamps.

To compute the average update time:

1. For all algorithms except SWMEB/SWMEB+, we record the CPU time for updating each batch of points and compute the update time of an algorithm by averaging the results at all sampled timestamps.
2. For SWMEB/SWMEB+, we record the total CPU time for updating all batches of points between two timestamps. So the average update time is computed by `(cpu_time2-cpu_time1)*batch_size/(timestamp2-timestamp1)`.

To compute the coreset size or number of stored points, we average `coreset_size` or `num_points` at all sampled timestamps.
